:text => %~"Listen," I say. "Andrew. Andy. Listen. I know. I am short, I have come to
accept this. I have found my peace with it. My serenity. But, but with that
serenity...with it comes a certain, a certain..."
    I throw my hand into the air, trying to pound the proper formulation of my
thoughts out of the ether. Some cold beer spills out of my plastic cup. I
notice it but barely feel it.
    "What I'm trying to say," I say, "is that with peace comes acceptance, and
with acceptance comes understanding. Understanding of the consequences. The
consequences of being short, I mean. Our society does not find short men
attractive. No girl is going to hook up with a guy who is shorter than them."
I pause, look up at Andrew pleadingly. "I need this Andy. Please."
    Andy looks down at me. He looks back up. He brushes some blond hair from
his eyes, looks over at Larissa and her friend. He says something to me, but
his voice is too soft for me to hear it above the pummeling music or the
chorus of people screaming to be heard above the pummeling music. Larissa and
her friend are, well, they look like they're shouting. But they look like
they're engrossed in a very interesting conversation. "What?" I shout back at
him. 
    "I said," he repeats, I guess, "We may simply have to trust her autonomy.
You know that some girls just..." he draws his hand down his ghoulish chest in
a great flourish, "...go for this. And you know I'd take a bullet for you, but
don't think I'm going to take a bullet for you and take the friend to get her
out of your way. I do have my limits. On the other hand, maybe she's not so
bad. And I do know you've been hard up after...and of course it is your..."
    But he's interrupted by the wave of silence that washes over the crowd. 
    Oh Jesus, they're up on the table.
    A couple of dudes stand on the kitchen table, take knives to beer cans and
shotgun them. Two more cans are passed up to them. The crowd cheers like
they're, they're...I don't know, the Beatles or something. Larissa and her
friend have stopped talking and are looking on disinterestedly.
    "Oh, fuck this," I say.
    Andy bends down on one knee, stretches out a long, lanky arm. Rests his
spindly hand on my shoulder. "Kyle, Kyle, Kyle. Look. They're distracted. Now's 
our chance."~,
:options => {:talktogirls => "Alright, let's do this.", :gosmoke => "No, go smoke"},
}



l << {
:name => :gosmoke, 
:text => %~"Forget this, man. I need a cigarette," I tell Andy. Without looking back I
shove my way through the crowd and head out the front door.
    A wall lantern overhead illuminates the porch. Between it and the pot
lights on the lawn it almost looks like midday, if you squint, and if you only
look at the grass, and if you're as tipsy as I am.
    I pull out a stainless steel cigarette case from my left breast pocket and
pop it open.
    Shit.
    Shit, shit, shit. There's only one left.~,
:options => {:smoke => "Fuck it, I need this now.", :dontsmoke => "Save it for later."},
}

l << {
:name => :talktogirls,
:text => %~Andy and I begin relocating ourselves, aiming to find ourselves in proximity of
Larissa and her friend. We've mastered the art of doing these sorts of things
without looking like we're doing this sort of thing, or, like, that we're
trying to do this sort of thing. There'd be something intimidating about seeing
two big, intimidating guys come up and try to hit on you, I think. It's not
smooth. You wanna look like you're barely trying at all.
    We slip and slide through cracks in the crowd. We pause every now and then,
exchange empty words with each other. Look around anxiously. Point at people we
don't know, ask each other, "do we know them?" We're careful but quick. The two
dudes are on their third beer? Fourth? We don't want Larissa and her friend to
get distracted. They're still quietly observing the performance.
    And then I somehow find myself next to Larissa. "This can't be good for
them. Underage drinking. It's very bad for young, developing brains." I'm
speaking just loud enough for her to hear me, to indicate that, yes, why yes,
I am talking to you.
    Larissa smiles. Her friend turns to me and says, "Don't worry about them.
Those guys don't have much to lose. You're Kyle, right? I'm Jane, and this is
Larissa."
    Andy suddenly slides up next to Jane. "Hey Jane. Hi Larissa. I'm
Andrew - or Andy, si vous préférez. As you know, this is indeed my dear friend
Kyle. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."
    "So," I say. "You having a good time?"
    Larissa looks down at the floor. Jane smirks. "Fantastic. Wonderful. And
such quality entertainment!" she says. "But seriously, some of the college
parties I've been to have scarcely been better than this. Not bad Kyle." 
    And then there's a lull in the conversation. I'm like wracking my brains
for something cool to say. It's not coming, and I feel my face flushing.
"Psst," Larissa whispers to Jane. "Should we...?"
    "Oh, yeah! Sure." Jane says. She waves at Andy & me and turns to go.
    But then Larissa nods at us. "J has some coke. You guys want any?"
    "Hey! I didn't say they could..."
    "It's fine. So guys?"~,
:options => {:docoke => "Go do coke.", :ditchandy => "No way, drugs are for pugs."},
}

l << {
:name => :docoke, 
:text => %~"Yeah, sure. We'll give it a shot."
    Andy nods in agreement. "You know what they say," he says. "Never buy it,
never sell it, never turn it down."
    I lead the four of us to the upstairs bathroom, which is a little bit
bigger and a little bit nicer and, you know, a little bit more out of the way
than the others. Jane riffles through her purse and pulls out a small plastic
baggy, maybe half full of white. "You know how much this cost me?" Larissa
looks a little wounded. But a little resolute, too.
    Along with the baggy, Jane also removes from a wallet in her purse an 
American $1 bill and a bank card. Then she pries open the baggy, tilts it onto
its side and carefully shakes out a small portion onto the bathroom counter.
Some of it's still clumped together, so she hacks at it with a credit card
until it's all broken down into a fine powder. She divides it into little
slices of white on the smooth black surface, four equal lines. Roughly equal,
anyway. One looks maybe a tiny bit bigger than another, which looks very
bigger than the other two. "You done this before?" she asks me and Andy. "Roll
it nice and tight like this, stick it in your nose like this, and hoover it -
like this." In one clean motion she sucks the biggest of the lines up. She
tilts her head back, sniffles for a bit, and when she's satisfied drops it back
down. "Don't let any go to waste."
    It's Larissa's turn now. She takes the bill from Jane and what she did,
vaccuuming up the next biggest line. Without a word she passes the roll over to
Andy. "Fortune favours the bold!" he whoops. He has a bit more trouble than
the girls did and picking up all of it - he has to go back and forth over the
line a bit to get all of it. Once he's done he waves his limbs around a bit
and lets out a celebratory "Yeah!"
    I, uh, I do my thing. Like Andy I have a bit of trouble. Whatever.
    "This feels kinda gross, in the general throat-slash-sinus way", I say, as
I sniffle and try to clear my throat.
    Jane smiles. "You come to appreciate that, because it means that in about
five minutes you're gonna be high as fuck."
    Oh boy is she right.
    I mean, I don't want to like sit here and bore you with, you know, the
details of being high on coke. Just fucking go do some yourself if you're that
curious about what it's like to just feel fucking great and awesome and like
your face is made of ice but in a really pleasant way. We head back out into
the party. Words start tumbling out of my mouth, I can't remember what but I'm
pretty fucking sure they were damn charming. Larissa isn't saying much but I'm
pretty sure she's impressed.
    One thing's bugging me though. Andy. Andy needs to fucking lay off. I can
tell his trying to go for Larissa too. Jane's more his type anyway. Should be.
Probably doing it just to demonstrate how much...how much more of a man he is.
Thinks he is.~,

l << {
:name => :ditchandy, 
:text => %~Andy grins. "You know what they say," he says. "Never buy it, never sell it,
never turn it down."
    But I'm not so sure. Now I'm no prude, but something about all this gives
me the heebie-jeebies. I know this'll probably cost me my shot with Larissa.
And I know that with me out of the way that means that Andy'll go for her, and
I know that what Andy wants Andy gets. But, I mean, I gotta draw a line
somewhere. "Sorry ladies", I tell them, "but I'm gonna have to pass this one
up."
    Andy scowls. "Seriously Kyle? Weak. And what about...?" he looks over at
Larissa and his disposition perks right up. "Well, whatever you're comfortable
with. See ya in a few!"
    The three of them strut off together. Christ. I need something.~,

l << {
:name => :smoke, 
:text => %~I strike a match and try to light up, but it starts to burn my fingertips
before I can get the cigarette to catch. I try again but this time the stupid
match falls to pieces. Finally, with my third match, I manage to light my
smoke. I take a deep drag, rest my elbows on the porch railing, and lean over
the barrier. A few other people are standing around on the front lawn,
chatting. They're smoking too, but I kind of want to be alone, you know?
    There's nothing so soothing as the blend of alcohol and nicotine. But I'm
not a third of the way through the cigarette when a voice pops out
from behind me. "Hey, you're Kyle, right? Um, is there any chance I could bum a
smoke?"
    I turn. Damn it. It's her. "Sorry, this is my last one."
    "Oh, okay." She starts to head down the stairs to the lawn.
    "Hold up. You, uh, you wanna split it?"
    "I can just..." she begins, and then shrugs. "Sure, why not?"~,

this later. Like if I do actually make a move on Larissa, somehow, and get
shot down. Shit, that's what cigarettes were invented for.
    Just then a voice pops out from behind me. "Hey, you're Kyle, right? Um,
is there any chance I could bum a smoke?"
    I turn. It's her. "Sure, no problem."
    I pop the cigarette into my mouth, get it going, and pass it over to her.
"That was a great sacrifice," I tell her. "My older brother's girlfriend gets
these from a reserve up north. Real high quality Indian cigarettes or some
shit, you know? Organic or some shit, made from the tobacco they've been
growing in their, like, traditional way for centuries. Who knows when I'll be
able to get more," I say, but I mean I'll probably be able to get some more
the next time I see her.~,

finally works against him, his centre of gravity is all messed-up and he goes
flying.
    Someone screams. Someone else cheers. The crowd starts chanting, "Fight!
Fight! Fight!"
    Andy gets back up. "What the fuck, man?!"

    I head out to the front yard to smoke. It's so quiet out here at this hour.
I pull my last cigarette out from the case in my left breast pocket and light
it up.
    There's a weird guy out on the lawn, another guy who's smoking, who I've
never seen before. He has the sort of face that looks like it could be
anywhere from 14 to 24. Who the fuck is this guy?
    "Hey, buddy," I say to him. "How's it going?"
    "It's going alright, thanks. Just needed some fresh air. I don't do so well
with crowds. And I enjoy it, you know. A cool summer night, a cigarette, time
to think..."
    "I feel ya man. I got some real crazy shit going through my head right
about now. But, uh, never mind that. What's on your mind?"
    "Have you ever heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma? A criminal is given the
choice of staying quiet or ratting on his accomplice. If he stays quiet, he
faces five years behind bars. If he talks, he goes free and his friend gets ten
years."
    "Okay. So why would he stay quiet?"
    "Well, his partner is given the same option, and if they both rat they'll
both have to do even more time - twenty years - than if they'd just stayed
quiet. If you try to think it through rationally, and assume your partner is
doing the same, it becomes a kind of paradox. Betraying your friend becomes a
kind of gamble."
    "Huh," I say. "Funny you should say that. I'm feeling awfully fucking
betrayed by my friend right about now."
    "You don't say. What about?"
    "Forget it. It's nothing."~,

vodka, and, uh, heartbreak...anyway, I can't remember it, but I need a drink.
    I climb up on the kitchen table with the other two. "Guys!" I yell. "I need
to catch up!" The crowd gleefully tosses three cans of beer at me. I catch one
and shield myself from the other two, which bounce mostly painlessly off my
wrist, fall down to the table, roll off, and are then picked up and placed
upright on the table once more by the eager crowd. How much have I had to
drink already?
    I shotgun the first beer and belch like a fucking champion. "Another!" I
bellow, grab the next one from feet and shotgun it, too.
    A surge of nausea comes crashing through my esophagus. How much have I had
to drink? I dunno if I can stomach another one...~,

    It's hard to read her face. She seems like she might be upset about
something. "You're Larissa, right? Didn't we have grade 9 geography together or
something? You having a good time?"
    "Yeah, it's a good party. Thanks. I'm okay...it's just...no. Never mind."
    "No, c'mon, you can tell me. We had geography class together, we're
practically, like, bosom buddies. C'mon."
    "Well, it's just..." She rolls her head back. "I have this friend, and she
means a lot to me, but...no, forget it. Sometimes I worry I'm too sensitive
about these things. I'm not supposed to care as much about the things
I care about. Do you ever feel like that? That, like, no one gives a fuck but
you?"
    I'm feeling kinda tipsy. There's a certain twinkle in her eyes, I think.
You can tell by the way her lips are, are, like, pulled in a certain direction,
or... I think. I think. She's looking at me expectantly.~,

	Time passes. I listen to the sounds of the people partying outside.

begin. The first 40 or so percents are easy. Then, very gently, 50, 55, 60...
    Larissa pulls away very suddenly. "Oh, wow, no, I'm sorry," she says. She
stands there. Her face is blushing, grimmacing. The ground suddenly looks so
much more interesting than before. "Uh, I'll just go back inside. Thanks for
the smoke. Um...sorry."
