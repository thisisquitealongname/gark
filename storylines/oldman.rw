It's a quiet day on Holly St. You're 81 years young and sitting on your porch.

<<look at the clouds>>
<<wait for someone to pass>>


You remember that in your day it always snowed on Christmas, candy was a nickle, and people helped each other out. Now kids and even those ramsputins today won't even look you in the eye. You're 81 years young and the only member of the street that sits out on your front porch.
