Our Four Layers of Uncooperation:
1) as a team, we're pretty uncooperative. we can even write the stories largely independently.
2) The storylines should all be about people not getting along, because that's great fodder. See: Skins, Pulp Fiction, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
3) the storylines have nothing to cooperate with each other about
4) ...except when they do, in which cases you have the opportunity to sabotage each other (or possibly help each other, possibly unwittingly)
