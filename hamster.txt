:: Start
It's morning. You want to explore.. but you've chewed all these bars before. You nibble at the same chunk of sawdust you peed on a month ago. Your life is one long, tediuous game of waiting, punctuated by terrifying moments of being swung up into the arms of your owners while they parrot the word "Squiggles". Confinement is second-nature -- it's almost as if you're playing a minor character in your own story.

You're in one of the few places you know.

:: Exit Cage
You scurry out the door. On the last bar, you realize there's nothing stopping your 4 foot descent onto the tile floor. You try to cling onto metal with your hind legs, but it's no use. You plummet.

Ouch. Son of a pellet. You can't move.

Exactly 4 hours and 3 minutes later, a foot descends onto you, splattering you across the tile.


:: Return To Cage
<<display "In Cage">>


:: Put Back In Cage
A hand swoops down and plucks you from the floor. You hear the stilted mnemonic "Squiggles!" as you're carried towards your cage.

<<if $hamsterCageDestroyed>>
	But HA! Your cage lies in shambles on the floor.
	"Squig-GLES! ... CAT!!!"
	
	You're deposited on a table in the bedroom. The giant jailkeeper spirals off in a heated pursuit. Eventually, you hear a faint "Mraww!" and the click of a door.

	The cat is outside.

:: Stay In Cage
You huddle in the corner of the cage, nibbling on a pellet and staring at your running wheel.

I'd better eat more before venturing out. Wise is the hamster that doesn't starve! <<actions "Eat Pellets">>
I think I'll go for a run. That looks fun. <<actions "Run On Wheel">>


:: Run On Wheel
You hop on, and begin to run.

Suddenly, you feel the wheel loosen and detach from the cage. The wheel hits the bottom of the cage and careens into the side, shifting the entire cage off of its resting place and onto the floor. The plastic bottom shatters.

Mortified and still wheelbound, you continue to run forwards until the wheel hits a wall and falls on its side. You climb out, rattled.

Mold and sawdust dominate your nose. Prickly fiberglass adheres to your coat. "Squeaks" echo in close proximity.

You brazenly leap towards the cat. Puff! You land in its fur and cling to its back.

Startled, the cat takes off and runs downstairs, zigzagging through a maze of legs. You fall off, landing on a red rug in a room full of people.

The cat scampers on, disappearing into the kitchen.
